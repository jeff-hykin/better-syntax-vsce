# Why would I want this?

Because there's a whole lot of probably-could-be-built-in features that you can get with one install.

# What are examples of some automatic features

The ability to open PDF's (yeah thats not built in)
File path auto-completion
Syntax highlighting colors for basically every language
Displays who made the last git change for the current line in your current file
Color-numbers (hex colors or RGB) are highlighted as their actual color
If you enable the built-in `renderWhitespace`, you'll see spaces, tabs, and newlines instead of only spaces and tabs
Auto-complete for C++
Auto-complete for Python

# What are examples of useful commands

Open and run basically any file with `CMD/CTRL + R`, thanks to code-runner
Compare a file between two git branches with `GitHD: View Branch Diff`, thanks to GitHD
